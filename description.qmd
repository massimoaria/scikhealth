:::

This section provides detailed metadata documentation for the variables used in the SciK-Health project datasets. Each block corresponds to a thematic group of indicators derived from OpenAlex and other integrated sources. The indicators are designed to support reproducible and comparative research on Italian AHSCs. They are measured by `AHC` (the short name of the hospital/university institution) and `PY` (Publication Year).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ“Š Bibliometric Dimension

These indicators describe the scientific production volume, authorship patterns, and collaboration dynamics of AHSCs.\
They are primarily computed using publication metadata from OpenAlex and enriched with journal quality metrics from SCOPUS.

## ðŸ“£ Altmetrics: Social & Digital Attention

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `nDoc_wALTM` | Number of articles in the year with at least one Altmetric Score (Altmetric Score \> 0) |
| `percDoc_wALTM` | Percentage of articles with Altmetric Score \> 0 out of total articles published |

***The 75th percentile (top 25%) was computed for the following indicators\****:

|  |  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `altmetric_score` | Altmetric Score value |
| `cited_by_accounts_count` | Number of unique accounts mentioning the article |
| `cited_by_fbwalls_count` | Number of Facebook wall mentions |

| `cohorts.com` | Number of general public users interacting with the article |
| `cohorts.doc` | Number of interactions by professionals (clinicians, operators, policy makers) |

\* For each Altmetric indicator, the 75th percentile (top 25% - `_thirdQu`) was calculated. The focus was placed on the 75th percentile to better capture significant engagement levels. This choice was made because a large proportion of publications lack Altmetric data or report zero activity across most sources, which could bias the overall statistics.
